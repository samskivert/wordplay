# Word Play

I like word games. I've always wanted to have a place where I can play around with word game ideas,
and build up a reusable (by me) library of components that I can use to quickly and easily test out
random word game ideas.

Since I hate every programming language and every game development framework, this has hamstrung me
for a long time. But I finally got over myself and started a [Pixi.js]-based project a while back
and neglected it, and then recently picked it back up and started adding a few ideas.

We shall see whether it grows over time, but I'm trying to minimize the overhead for adding a new
game idea, and maximize the learnings. Mmm... delicious learnings.

## Building

At some point I'll try to get something set up that automatically builds this project whenever I
commit new code and sticks it up on some website so that it can be played. The easy availability to
anyone who wants to try these things out was a big motivator to take the pain of writing it all in
TypeScript. But I haven't done that yet, so if you want to try them out, you have to build it
yourself.

This is not rocket science, just web development (worse in many ways), so you hopefully know the
drill:

```
npm install
node devsever.js
```

## Feedback

If by some shocking chance you have in fact read these words, and played the games, and have ideas
for new variations or improvements, please send them along. Email is good
<a href="mailto:mdb@samskivert.com">mdb@samskivert.com</a> or open a Github issue or send up smoke
signalss or whatever else you like.
